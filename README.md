# Instagram Clone
This project is a full on frontend react app that clones an Instagram page. 
The page features a fixed nav bar that follows you as you scroll down the page. 
The page is seperated into multiple components (Header, UpperPage, MiddlePage, LowerPage, and Footer). The layout utlizes css flex bot and css grid. The images were placed in an object and passed down as a prop and then mapped over to create a div in each row and column of the grid. The page is also completely mobile responsive using media queries to achieve this result.
